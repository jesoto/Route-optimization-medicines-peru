# VRP Peru ‚Äì Route Optimization Engine for Medicine Delivery

## ü©∫ Problem Statement
In rural and dispersed areas of Peru, such as the Apur√≠mac region, the delivery of medicines and medical supplies faces significant logistical challenges: long distances, hard-to-access routes, and limited resources.  
This project implements a **graphical and algorithmic engine** that optimizes delivery routes, originally designed for medicine distribution in Peru but adaptable to other countries or sectors (logistics, food, parcel delivery, etc.).

Using **Python**, **OR-Tools**, and **OSRM**, it calculates optimal routes to minimize travel distance and delivery time, while **Streamlit** provides an interactive interface for non-technical users.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Route optimization with real-world constraints.
- Interactive map visualization of the optimal route.
- Distance and estimated time calculation between each point.
- Supports up to **5 destinations** per route (configurable).
- Allows selection of **starting point** and individual destination management.
- Scalable to multiple vehicles and special conditions (e.g., refrigerated cargo, weight limits, time windows).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Conda or venv recommended.
- Packages:
  - `streamlit`
  - `folium`
  - `pandas`
  - `requests`
  - `ortools`
  - `geopy`
